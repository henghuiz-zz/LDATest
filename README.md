# Latent Dirichlet Allocation For Topic Modeling

This is the supplementary files for final project of BU EC 503, *Latent Dirichlet Allocation For Topic Modeling*. The package LDATest provides the following functions.

1. Generate corpus that can be used in Gensim LDA analysis.
2. Provide the matching algorithm to calibrate the indexes of the ground true synthetic beta and the beta obtained by LDA analysis.
3. Use K means to perform LDA analysis as baseline.
